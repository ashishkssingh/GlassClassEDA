# **Exploratory Data Analysis - Red Wine Quality Dataset**
Day 5 of 100 Days of Exploratory Data Analysis

## **Content**
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality , I just shared it to kaggle for convenience. (If I am mistaken and the public license type disallowed me from doing so, I will take this down if requested.)
